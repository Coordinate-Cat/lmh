I don't know when it started, but when I launch sveltekit and make a screen transition, it returns a 500 error.

I was having trouble solving the problem by switching the favicon extension to .png or .ico.
Also rewrote the svelte-specific `%svelte.assets%` to the path where the favicon is actually located, but this did not solve the problem.

However, this was easier than expected to fix with the following modification.

[Why is sveltekit fetching for favicon.png in subpath?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71049580/why-is-sveltekit-fetching-for-favicon-png-in-subpath)

In the comments below the question of this one, I found the following answer.
> href="%svelte.assets%/favicon.png"- I added a slash to this line and the error went away - href="/%svelte.assets%/favicon.png"

Apparently, all you need to do is prefix `%svelte.assets%` with `/`. Like this `/%svelte.assets%/favicon.ico`.
